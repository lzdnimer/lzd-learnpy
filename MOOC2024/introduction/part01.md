## Use cases for Python

### As a replacement or complementary tool to Excel
* Excel can be used for most tasks including advanced analysis, but Python can help in replication of work. When working on Excel, it's not easy to document all the analysis steps being performed especially intermediary steps (e.g., filtering data). In most situations, Python code can be shared and used easily across teams.
* Excel also has limits in size and compute time. It may be easier and cheaper (in terms of compute) to solve a business issue using Python

## Lesson 1: Getting started

### Variables
Assigning a variable twice means that the first variable is forgotten:
```
x = 123
print(x) # 123
x = 234
print(x) # 234
```
